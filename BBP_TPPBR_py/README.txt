This code was not made by me.  I have only made changes for this code to interopt with my Bot code.


1. you need python2.7 to run the program, get it at: https://www.python.org/

2. Double click the program to open it

3. type in the first 3 pokemon on blue team, and then the 3 pokemon on red team 

	- pokemon 1 = blue lead, pokemon 2 = blue mid, pokemon 3 = blue anchor, pokemon 4 = red lead, pokemon 5 = red mid, pokemon 6 = red anchor

	- you do NOT have to spell the entire name! you can usually get away with just the 4 characters of the name ie "Aria" for ariados, "Charma" for Charmander, or "Um" for umbreon

4. the prediction will appear when all 6 mons have been provided




NOTES:

Mr. Mime needs to be spelled "MrMime"
Mime Jr. needs to be spelled "MimeJr"
nidoran f or m needs to be spelled "NidoranM" or "NidoranF"
Farfetch'd needs to be spelled "Farfetchd"
Ho-Oh needs to be spelled "HoOh"

formes can be entered too! input their appropriate forme name without a space after their name
examples:
burmyplant, gastrodoneast, deoxysdefense, arceusdragon, arceusnormal





REMEMBER - the biggest part of this game is betting, intelligent bets are more important than knowing who will win
